# Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction

This is a project about extracting text with emotion from tweets. The complete dataset is available on Kaggle and you can go through it to get a bit of understanding of what the whole project is about. For this NLP task I'm planning to create a semantic model that can read the text, identify the starting and ending indices of the output text (ones with the specified emotion), and then output the converted digits as the output and check with metrics like accuracy and jaccard score.


Kaggle competition dataset: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data)

Steps to take:
1. EDA:
- Jaccard score.
- Word Cloud


2. Preprocessing:
- Nothing but lowercasing, which might not be even necessary!
